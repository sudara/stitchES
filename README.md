Stitching Together MP3 Playback in HTML5 Audio with ES6

## Our goal

To distill and codify 10+ years experience of building dozens of web music players into a tight, usable library with 0 dependencies.

## Features

Stitches6...

* Is written in ES6+
* Completely ignores the Web Audio API (which doesn't allow buffering, therefore useless for music playback)
* Only handles the MP3 format (pragmatically, the only format that matters)
* Lets you decide if you want to babel things or just include in a `<script type=module>`
* Is defensive, but doesn't test for browsers or feature detect
* Assumes you have a playlist
* Assumes you want to preload one of the tracks
* Assumes you want to have continuous playback of a playlist (preloads next tracks)
* Assumes you care as much about mobile as you do desktop
* Deals with "unlocking" audio elements from their auto-play restrictions

## We worked hard so you don't have to

Unfortunately the state of HTML5 Audio support on browsers has not evolved much in the last decade, leaving the API incomplete and unreliable across platforms. Stitches has your back by:

* Unlocking multiple audio nodes on an interaction so you can play through multiple tracks

* Abstracts out and normalizes HTML5 audio events so that they actually work cross-browser (For example, [onended in iOS has been broken for years](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173332)).

* Comes with defaults that enable gapless playback, with an ability to tune.

## Installation

`yarn install stitches6`

## Usage

With a bundler like Webpack you can:

`
import Playlist from 'stitches6'
`

With raw html, you can:

```
<script type='module'>
  import Playlist from './src/playlist.js'
  const playlist = Playlist.newFromSelector('a')
</script>
```

## How does it work?

We stitch together `<audio>` elements to provide a rudimentary (and hopefully excellent) playback experience.

Ideally browsers would be able to play a list of audio tracks. Instead we are stuck with creating individual `<audio>` elements, which in many browsers are each blocked from playing until after an user interaction event, such as a click.

From an experience point of view, we want to provide gapless playback of an album or playlist. We definitely don't want to force the user to keep interacting to get the next song. Ideally, they can open up new browser tabs and do their thing and an album will happily stream in the background.

To mitigate the fact that browsers sabotage this ability, we create a `NodePool` that holds `AudioNodes` (a wrapper around an individual `<audio>` element). On user interaction, we unlock (ie. call `.play()`) on each element in the `NodePool`, using a tiny silent mp3 (it's sketchy on some browsers to call `.play()` with an empty `src`)

For continuous/gapless playback we really only need two `<audio>` elements: One to handle a currently playing track and another to preload the next audio track in. When a file is done playing, the node is released back to the pool.

## Visualizing the object relationships

```
                   ┌-----------┐
                   | Playlist  |
                   └-----------┘
                    /    |    \
                   /     |     \
          ┌-------┐  ┌-------┐  ┌-------┐
          | Track |  | Track |  | Track |
          └-------┘  └-------┘  └-------┘
                         ↓
          hi, can i have an unlocked node plz?
                         ↓
                   ┌-----------┐
                   | Node Pool |
                   └-----------┘
                    /    |    \
                   /     |     \
            ┌------┐  ┌------┐  ┌------┐
            | Node |  | Node |  | Node |
            └------┘  └------┘  └------┘
                |         |         |
             <Audio>   <Audio>   <Audio>
```

## Why?

10 years ago, I launched alonetone.com. Since then, I've written several wrappers around audio libraries such as SoundManager2 and Howler.js, both which are fantastic projects and very much enabled me to launch and maintain the site.

However, as time wore on, I found myself constantly having to keep up with the changes to audio behavior in browsers anyway, and more recently, have found the implementations lacking. In particular, other libraries tend to:

* Contain legacy/unrelated support of other methods of delivery like Flash and Web Audio
* Don't have first class support for sequential playback of a playlist
* Are written in Ye Olde JS™ vs. ES6/2017
* Are full of browser/feature detection code


## Running tests

For a project like this, given the somewhat sketchy state audio playback in browsers, it's absolutely critical to run tests against current browsers.

Selenium tests are currently written in Nightwatch.

You can run them locally with `yarn test` and it will run them in just against headless chrome as configured in `nightwatch-local.conf.json`.

We are using browserstack to actually run the tests against multiple browsers. This is configured in `nightwatch-browserstack.conf.js` and uses a runner defined in `browserstack.runner.js`. Travis is setup to run browserstack, but you can also run browserstack locally (assuming you have credentials) with `yarn browserstack`

Note that test failures on selenium (and therefore browserstack) are manually registered via browserstack's API.
